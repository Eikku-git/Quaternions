Open ExampleScene and switch between NewTest and OldTest by turning the GameObjects on and off.
In OldTest I make my own mesh and keep track of and draw the vertices manually and do all the transformations manually.
In NewTest I use a regular Unity mesh asset and let Unity handle the transformation matrix (I only calculate the rotations).
